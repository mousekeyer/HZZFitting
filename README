---------
Setup
---------
To setup just use the script:
    source setup.sh
(should work on any machine with access to afs - provided that nothing else is set-up previously)

To compile:
    make
(this will take as main code the file util/myFit.C)
or specify a custom main file as argument:
    make  util/myNewCustomFit.C
   
      
---------
How to   
---------
To run the code, after compiling (see "Setup"), use the command:
    ./myFit.exe  <action(s)>  [<config file>]  [<update>]  [<options>]

The configuration file (<config file>) is a text file containing all the information on the definition of samples and fit regions, including all the fit and draw options.
By default the file  config/myFit.config  is loaded.
See the section "Config File" for more details.
As examples give a look at  config/myFit.config  or  config/ttH2015.config .
Most of the times the only file the user has to modify to get his fit is the configuration file. 

The only mandatory argument, <action(s)>, tells to the TtHFitter which operation(s) to perform. 
The possible operations are defined in the main file (e.g. util/myFit.C). 
For instance, if you use the default file util/myFit.C, the available options are:
    h : read input histograms (valid only if the proper option is spefified in the config file)
    n : read input ntuples (valid only if the proper option is spefified in the config file)
    w : create the RooStats xmls and workspace
    f : fit the workspace
    l : calculate exclusion limit
    s : calculate significance
    d : draw pre-fit plots
    p : draw post-fit plots
    a : draw separation plots
    r : draw ranking plot (see later)
    b : re-run smoothing (in the future also rebinning)

The argument <update> can be 0 or 1 and tells the tool whether the root file containing the histograms should be overwritten or updated.
Use only for actions n and h.

New optional argument: <options>.
It's a string (so make sure to use " or ' to enclose the string if you use more than one option) defining a list of options, in the form:
    "<option1>=<value1>,<value2>,...:<option2>=..."
See the section "Command line options" above.
    

---------
Config File   
---------
Here's a list of the inputs and options which can be specifed in the config file:

 - The structure of the file shoudl be the following:

     <ObjectType>: <ObjectName>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       ...
     
     <ObjectType>: <ObjectName>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       <ObjectProperty>: <Value>
       ...

     ...

    (NB: note the blank line between the objects!!)
    
 - The file should contain:
     * exactly one object of type "Fit"
     * at least one object of type "Sample"
     * at least one object of type "Region"
     * any number of objects of type "Systematic" (even 0 should be ok)
   Each object should have unique <ObjectName>.
      
 - Then, for each object type, here's a PARTIAL list of properties to be speficied:

    Job:
      Label            -> it's the label which will be showed on the plots
      POI              -> the name of the parameter of interest; this should correspond to a NormFactor defined below
      ReadFrom         -> can be HIST or NTUP; default is HIST
      HistoPath        -> valid only for option HIST above is selected; it's the path where the input root files containing the histograms are stored
      NtuplePath(s)    -> valid only for option NTUP; it's the path(s) where the input root files containing the ntuples are stored
      MCweight         -> only for option NTUP; string defining the weight (for MC samples only)
      Selection        -> only for option NTUP; string defining the selection
      NtupleName       -> default name of the tree
      Lumi             -> value to scale all the "NormalizedByTheory" samples
      LumiScale        -> additional value to scale 'after' histogram creation (for fast scaling) IMPORTANT: use it only if you know what you are doing!!
      SystPruningShape -> Lower threshold to remove a shape systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (Ex: 0.02 for 2%)
      SystPruningNorm  -> Lower threshold to remove a normalisation systematic from the fit/limit (suppression is done per sample and per region) (Ex: 0.02 for 2%)
      SystLarge        -> all systematics above this threshold will be flagged in the pruning plot) (e.g. 0.4 will flag systematics that are larger than 40%)
      IntCodeOverall   -> interpolation code used for the normalization component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats)
      IntCodeShape     -> interpolation code used for the shape component of systematics (should match the one used in RooStats)
      MCstatThreshold  -> if set it will add the MC stat uncertainty to the fit (and to the plots); a NP will be added for each bin with an MC stat uncertainty > this threshold (relative)
      DebugLevel       -> 0 or 1
      PlotOptions      -> a set os options for plotting:
        YIELDS : if set, the legend will be one-column and will include the yileds; otherwise two-columns and no yields
        NORMSIG : add normlised signal to plots
        NOSIG: don't show signal in stack
        OVERSIG: overlay signal (not normalised)
      SystControlPlots -> if set to true, plots will be dumped showing the shape effect of a given systematic (before and after smoothing/symmetrisation)
      SystDataPlots    -> if set to true, plots will be dumped showing the shape effect of a given systematic (before and after smoothing/symmetrisation) on top of the nominal sum of samples.
      		          Data are then plotted in the ratio. If the option is set to "fillUpFrame" data will also be plotted in the upper frame.
      CorrelationThreshold -> Threshold used to draw the correaltion matrix (only systematics with at least one correlation larger than than draw) (0.05->5%)
      SignalRegionsPlot-> list of regions to put in SignalRegionsPlot; use "EMPTY" to put an empty entry, "ENDL" to specify end of line
      HistoChecks      -> NOCRASH: means that if an error is found in the input histograms, the code continues (with only warnings) -- default leads to a crash in case of problem
      LumiLabel        -> label for luminosity to be put on plots
      CmeLabel         -> label for center-of-mass energy to be put on plots

      FitRegion        -> can be CRSR (default) or CRONLY to fit considering both signal and control regions in the fit, or only control regions
                          You can also specify a coma-separated list of regions to use in the fit
      FitBlind         -> specify is real data or Asimov data should be used in the fit (TRUE or FALSE). By default, fit are NOT blind.
      POIAsimov        -> value of the parameter of interest in the AsimovDataset used in the fit
      NPValues         -> values of the nuisance parameters used to build the fit. Coma-separated list of NP:value (e.g. alpha_ttbarbb_XS:1,alpha_ttbarbcc_XS:1.5)
      doLHscan         -> coma separated list of names of the POI or NP from which you want to produce the likelihood scan, if first element of the list is "all" then all systematics are profiled
      UseMinos         -> coma separated list of names of the POI and/or NP for which you want to calculate the MINOS errors, if first element of the list is "all" then the MINOS errors is calculated for all systematics and POIs

    Limit:
      LimitType        -> can be ASYMPTOTIC or TOYS (the latter is not yet supported)
      LimitBlind       -> can be TRUE or FALSE (TRUE means that ALL regions are blinded)
      POIAsimov        -> value of the POI to inject in the Asimov dataset in LimitBlind is set to TRUE
      
    Options:           (additional options, accepting only float as arguments - useful for adding your functionalities & flags in a quick way, since they need minimal changes in the code)
      ...

      Label            -> it's the label which will be showed on the plots and specifies which region is shown

      Samples:     to limit the samples to use to the list specified
      Systematics: to limit the systematics to use to the list specified
